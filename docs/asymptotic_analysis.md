# Asymptotic Analysis - DRAFT

 - Measures the order of growth of time taken by the function or program it takes to execute.
 - Not a programming language specific.
 - No need to implement the function to analyse its time complexity.

Write an expression based on the input size.


    We always assume that any mathematical operation or conditional expression takes only same time, irrespective of its size.
